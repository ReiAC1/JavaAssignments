# Collections

## Maps

In Java, Maps are a collection type takes 2 different generic types, 1 for the key, and 1 for the value.
Keys must be unique, as these are the identifiers used to access data values.
Similarly to emails. The email address being the key, and all the data/emails associated with the email address being the value.

### HashMaps

HashMaps are an implementation of the Map datatype that uses Java's hashCode function in to process unique Keys.

### LinkedHashMaps

Similarly to above, LinkedHashMaps also use the hashCode function, but also maintains order to the map, whereas HashMap has no regards for order


## Assignment:

In this assignment, I have created a base function "mapDemo" which performs a number of tasks: adding elements, removing elements,
and finally using a stream in order to turn all keys into lowercase values.
